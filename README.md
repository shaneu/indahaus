## ⛏️ Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

- [errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors) - Provides a nice way to capture errors along with their context 
- [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) - Elegant project configuration that allows us to define sane default
parameters and override them with env vars
- [go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) - The only sqlite driver that is included in and has passed the go driver compatibility test suite [doc](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers)
- [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) - provides some nice extensions beyond what is delivered by the built in sql library while still being fully interface compliant. Will be useful if we decide to change from sqlite to something like postgres
